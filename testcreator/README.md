<h1>TestCreator<h1>

We create an api that integrates with chatGPT and asks through a prompt a creation of a code challenge
sending: 
 - language 
 - version
 - idiom 

we want it to be created. After that we would apply the
code challenge on the candidate. After he finishes we send his solution through another endpoint asking
chatGPT to evaluate the proposed solution.
